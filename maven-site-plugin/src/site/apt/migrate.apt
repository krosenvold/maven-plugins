Migrate

  The Site Plugin has had a couple of upgrades that requires the user to make
  adjustments to their environment, documents or configuration. Below is a list
  of these changes and what you as a user need to be aware of.

* From 2.x to 3.x

  * Version 3 of the plugin requires at least <<Maven 2.2.0>> to run.

  * If you use <<Maven 3>> please read the {{{./maven-3.html}Maven 3}} guide about relevant issues.

  []

* From 2.2.x to 2.3.x

  * The <<<site:stage>>> and <<<site:stage-deploy>>> goals have been decoupled from site generation.
  Executing these goals without generating the site first will lead to a build failure.

  []

* From 2.1.x to 2.2.x

  * The plugin now requires at least <<Maven 2.2.0>> to run, you cannot use it
  with older Maven versions.

  * The plugin now requires at least <<Java 5>> to run, you cannot use it
  with older Java versions.

  []

* From 2.0.x to 2.1.x

  * The plugin now requires at least <<Maven 2.1>> to run, you cannot use it
  with older Maven versions.

  * The plugin has been upgraded to use <<Doxia 1.1>>, which has seen a lot of
  major changes itself. If you experience unexpected behavior, please read these
  resources:
