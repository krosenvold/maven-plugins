Adding a Protocol to Deploy the Site 

  Maven 3 - then Maven Site Plugin - comes with minimal built-in protocol support: <<<file>>>, <<<http>>>, <<<https>>>.
  Maven 2 adds <<<scp>>> to this list.

  To deploy a site with a non-built-in protocol, you'll need to add a new {{{http://maven.apache.org/wagon}wagon provider}}.

  You can add it either as a global extension, or just let it at site plugin level:

<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${project.version}</version>
          <dependencies>
            <dependencies>
              <dependency><!-- add support for ssh/scp -->
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.wagon</groupId>
                <artifactId>wagon-ssh</artifactId>
                <version>1.0</version>
              </dependency>
            </dependencies>
          </dependencies>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>
  </build>
  ...
