The projects under parentNotAsRef/ and parentAsRef/ are identical
except for the inheritAsRef parameter in the parent's site.xml.

No tests are run for parentAsRef/, it is only built for comparison.

This is identical to IT inheritedMenus (which currently fails with m3, see MSITE-560),
apart from m3-style plugin configuration.
