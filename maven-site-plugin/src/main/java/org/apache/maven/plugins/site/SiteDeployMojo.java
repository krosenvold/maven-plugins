/**
 * Deploys the generated site using <code>scp</code> or <code>file</code>
 * protocol to the site URL specified in the
 * <code>&lt;distributionManagement&gt;</code> section of the POM.
 * <p>
 * For <code>scp</code> protocol, the website files are packaged into zip archive,
 * then the archive is transfered to the remote host, next it is un-archived.
 * This method of deployment should normally be much faster
 * than making a file by file copy.  For <code>file</code> protocol, the files are copied
 * directly to the destination directory.
