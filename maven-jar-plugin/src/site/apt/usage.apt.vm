Usage

  Some brief examples on how to use this plugin. If you want to use advanced
  configurations you should have a look at the documentation for
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-archiver/}Maven Archiver}}.

  To handle archiving this version of Maven JAR Plugin uses
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-archiver/index.html}Maven Archiver}} ${mavenArchiverVersion}.

  <<Note:>> Originally, this plugin was meant to sign JARs as well. As of version 2.3, the corresponding goals are no
  longer supported and users are advised to use the dedicated
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-jarsigner-plugin/}Maven Jarsigner Plugin}} instead.


* How to build a JAR file

  If the packaging of your project is set to 'jar', this plugin is executed
  whenever it passes the "package" phase. You can execute it
  using the command below:

+-----------------+
mvn package
+-----------------+

  In your project's <<<target>>> directory you'll able to see the generated jar file.


* How to include/exclude content from jar artifact

  Specify a list of fileset patterns to be included or excluded by adding
  <<<\<includes\>>>>/<<<\<include\>>>> or <<<\<excludes\>>>>/<<<\<exclude\>>>>
  in your <<<pom.xml>>>.

+-----------------+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <includes>
            <include>**/service/*</include>
          </includes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----------------+

  Note that the patterns need to be relative to the path specified for the plugin's
  <<<classesDirectory>>> parameter.


* How to create an additional attached jar artifact from the project

  Specify a list of fileset patterns to be included or excluded by adding
  <<<\<includes\>>>>/<<<\<include\>>>> or <<<\<excludes\>>>>/<<<\<exclude\>>>>
  and add a <<<classifier>>> in your <<<pom.xml>>>.

  <<Note:>> the jar-plugin must be defined in a new execution, otherwise it
  will replace the default use of the jar-plugin instead of adding a second
  artifact. The <<<classifier>>> is also required to create more than one artifact.
