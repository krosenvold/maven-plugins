Maven Multi Module Configuration

  With a multi modules build, you cannot simply use <<<mvn site-deploy>>>: you must stage your site first.

  Cli commands to use:

+------------+
mvn -Preporting site site:stage
mvn scm-publish:publish-scm
+------------+

  These commands work well with mono-module too, even if mono-module could permit some optimizations (everything can be run
  in only one Maven invocation).
