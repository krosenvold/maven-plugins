/**
 * Like the <code>assembly:attached</code> goal, assemble an application bundle or distribution from an assembly
 * descriptor, WITHOUT first forcing Maven to build all POMs to the <code>package</code> phase (as is required by the
 * <code>assembly:assembly</code> goal). This goal differs from <code>assembly:attached</code> in that it ignores the
 * &lt;formats/&gt; section of the assembly descriptor, and forces the assembly to be created as a directory in the
 * project's build-output directory (usually <code>./target</code>). <br/>
 * <p/>
 * This goal is also functionally equivalent to using the <code>assembly:attached</code> goal in conjunction with the
 * <code>dir</code> assembly format. <br/>
 * <p/>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> This goal should ONLY be run from the command line, and if building a multimodule project it should be
 * used from the root POM. Use the <code>assembly:directory-single</code> goal for binding your assembly to the
 * lifecycle.

 * @deprecated Use assembly:single and an assembly with format == dir instead! This mojo is redundant, and leads to
 * non-standard builds.
