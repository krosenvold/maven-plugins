Maven Plugins Parent POM

    This POM is the common parent of all of the Maven plugins
    in the Apache Maven project.

    Every Maven plugin provide ITs (Integration Tests) to check real plugin execution.
    Nothing is defined in this parent POM about ITs since every project has its own requirements
    to run its ITs, but by convention, these ITs are defined by every plugin in a <<<run-its>>> profile:

+---
mvn -Prun-its integration-test
+---

    As of version 21, this POM sets the Java source and target versions to 1.5. Thus any plugin
    moved to version 21+ of this POM moves to requiring Java 1.5.
